# Sentiment Analysis and Recommendation System 📊🛍️

## Project Overview 🤔

In the world of e-commerce, enhancing the shopping experience for customers is critical to increasing satisfaction and sales. This project aims to address two key aspects:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding customer feedback by analyzing reviews to determine the sentiment behind them (positive, negative, or neutral).
2. **Product Recommendations**: Offering personalized product suggestions based on customer behavior and preferences to make their shopping experience smoother and more enjoyable.

## What the System Does 💡

This project combines two major components:

### 1. **Sentiment Analysis** 🧠
- It analyzes customer reviews on products to assess how customers feel about the items they’ve purchased.
- Uses text normalization techniques to improve the quality of the analysis.
- **TextBlob** and **NLTK** are used to process and analyze text data, ensuring that the results are more accurate and insightful.

### 2. **Recommendation Engine** 🔮
- The recommendation engine suggests products to customers based on their past behaviors and similar product characteristics.
- It uses **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to understand the content of product descriptions and **K-NN** (K-Nearest Neighbors) to suggest similar products.
- This helps customers discover items they might be interested in, improving their shopping experience.

## Tools & Technologies 🛠️

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**:
  - **TextBlob** 📝: For performing sentiment analysis.
  - **NLTK** 📚: For text preprocessing, such as stemming and lemmatization.
  - **scikit-learn** 🔍: For implementing the K-NN algorithm and TF-IDF vectorization in the recommendation engine.
  - **pandas** 📊: For handling and manipulating data.
  - **NumPy** 🔢: For numerical operations.

## How It Works 🚀

### Sentiment Analysis
- **Preprocessing**: Text data from customer reviews is cleaned and processed using text normalization techniques (stemming and lemmatization).
- **Analysis**: Sentiment is assessed using **TextBlob** to classify reviews into categories like positive, negative, or neutral.

### Recommendation Engine
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Converts product descriptions into numerical data for machine learning models to understand the text.
- **K-NN Algorithm**: Recommends products based on similarity measures between products, helping customers find related items.

## Why It Matters 🌟

This project provided me with hands-on experience in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science**. By applying these skills, I built a solution that not only enhances sentiment analysis but also improves the overall e-commerce shopping experience through personalized product recommendations.
